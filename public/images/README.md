# Images for Picture Matching Exercises

Place your Rif language image files in this directory with the following naming convention:

## Required Images:

- `aryaz.png` - Man (homme)
- `tamɣart.png` - Woman (femme) 
- `arba.png` - Boy (garçon)
- `tarbat.png` - Girl (fille)
- `wacunt.png` - Family (famille)

## Image Requirements:

- **Format**: PNG format (`.png` extension)
- **Size**: Recommended 512x512 pixels or larger
- **Quality**: Clear, high-contrast images that are easily recognizable
- **Background**: Preferably clean/simple backgrounds for better visibility

## Usage:

These images are used in Picture Matching exercises (#7, #11, #12, #13, #14) where users see an image and must select the correct Tarifit word from multiple choice options.

## Fallback:

If an image file is missing or fails to load, a placeholder image will be displayed automatically.
